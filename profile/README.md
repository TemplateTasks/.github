Hello there!

Welcome to [Template Tasks](https://www.templatetasks.com/) - my personal project!

My name is [Vadim Starichkov](https://github.com/starichkovva/), and I am software engineer with more than a decade of experience in commercial software development.

Idea behind this project is actually a quite simple - to implement and share some common stuff like libraries and micro-services, which we, developers, are have to implement again and again, through the years, companies and projects.

Thus, the moto - *Implement. Share. Reuse.*
