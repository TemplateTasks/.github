Hello there!
Thanks for stopping by!

My name is [Vadim Starichkov](https://github.com/starichkovva/), and I am software engineer.

Welcome to my personal project - [Template Tasks](https://www.templatetasks.com/).

The idea behind this project is actually quite simple - to implement and share some common stuff like libraries and micro-services.
Stuff we, developers, are have to implement again and again, through the years, companies and projects.

Thus, the moto:

> Implement. Share. Reuse.

And a quote I really like:

> Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
